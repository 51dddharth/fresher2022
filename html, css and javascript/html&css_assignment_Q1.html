            <h3><strong>Early Life</strong></h3>
            <p>Actor Alan Sydney Patrick Rickman was born on February 21, 1946, in West London, England. He was the second of four children born to Bernard Rickman, an Irish Catholic factory worker, and Margaret Doreen Rose Rickman, a Welsh Methodist housewife. After showing an early predilection for art, Rickman won a scholarship to Latymer Upper School in London, where he appeared in several school plays, and then studied graphic design at Chelsea College of Art and Design and the Royal College of Art. After graduating, he started a graphic design company, Graphiti, with some friends. He met his lifetime partner Rima Horton in 1965 while in the amateur Group Court Drama Club.</p>

            <h3 class="text-right"><strong>Early Career and Breakthrough Role</strong></h3>
            <p class="text-right">In 1978, Rickman joined the prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company, appearing in <em>The Tempest</em> and <em>Love's Labour's Lost</em>, among others, although he disliked the experience. Moving on from the RSC, Rickman spent much of the rest of the 1980s acting in BBC serials, radio dramas and repertory theater.</p>
            <p class="text-right">The turning point in Rickman's career came in 1985 with the starring role of Le Vicomte de Valmont in <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em>, a part that playwright Christopher Hampton developed with the actor specifically in mind. Rickman performed the unforgettably villainous role first in London and then on Broadway, earning a Tony Award nomination</p>

        <h3><strong>Villanous Roles and Harry Potter Films</strong></h3>
        <p>Rickman was soon tapped for his first Hollywood film role, as the impossibly evil terrorist Hans Gruber in <em>Die Hard</em> (1988). In 1991, he starred in <em>Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves</em>, in which he played an unforgettably arch Sheriff of Nottingham. This role, accentuating the first impression made in Die Hard, cemented Rickman's image as a "villain" actor — a title Rickman disliked</p>
        <p>Rickman's next high-profile role came in the 2000s, when he took on the key part of Professor Severus Snape in the Harry Potter movies. Author J.K. Rowling specifically wanted Rickman for the role, briefing him on unpublished backstory about the character to help him prepare for the role. Rickman went on to play the role in all eight Harry Potter films.</p>
